          <h2 class="mb-5">Skills &amp; Technologies</h2>

          <div class="subheading">Systems Administration</div>
          <p class="mb-4">I have several years experience administering Linux and Windows servers. I have been working with Windows since the early 2000s, and Linux since around 2005. While I prefer working with Debian based systems, I do have some experience with CentOS as well. My primary focus has been web servers both Apache and more recently Nginx. I am also well versed in virtualization and containerization. I am experienced with VMWare vSphere, ProxMox, VirtualBox, and Docker.</p>

          <div class="subheading">Programming &amp; Web Development</div>
          <p>I started building websites in the early 2000s, and I quickly expanded to web application programming. I am well versed in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. Most applications I have built typically have a MySQL back-end, so I am well versed in MySQL administration as well. In my website development experience, I have worked extensively with WordPress and Joomla.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">I recently started exploring automation techniques, and I have been learning Python in the process. I am also moderately familiar with Bash and PowerShell. I typically use Git for code versioning and I have utilized both GitHub and GitLab for projects. In addition to these languages, I have also written many logon and logoff scripts for Active Directory in VBScript.</p>
          
          <div class="subheading">Network Engineering &amp; Administration</div>
          <p>I have extensive experience working with both MikroTik routers and Juniper switches. In 2013 I received my MTCNA, MTCRE, and MTCTCE (see certifications) covering almost every aspect of networking with MikroTik devices. I have led several network implementations regarding both brands of devices, and engineered traffic flows within these networks as well.</p>
          <p>In addition to MikroTik and Juniper, I also have experience with Cisco IOS switches, Aruba wireless access points and controllers, Ubiquiti networking equipment, and Adtran switches.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Aside from technologies, I am well versed in subnetting IPv4, configuring VLANs for network segregation, and utilizing dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF. Additionally, I have experience working with QoS for prioritizing traffic, and aggregating interfaces to increase bandwidth capabilities as well as providing redundancy. I also have experience configuring TACACS+ and RADIUS (in the form of 802.1x) for authentication, authorization, and accounting.</p>


          <div class="subheading">Network &amp; Information Security</div>
          <p>Network and computer security have always been a passion of mine. My focus for both application development and network engineering has always been on achieving objectives securely.</p>
          <p>From a network perspective, I have configured a wide range of firewalls and VPN connections. Some of the firewalls I have worked with are: WatchGuard, Sophos, PFSense, MikroTik, and IPTables. The two primary VPN configurations I am most familiar with are IPSec and OpenVPN.</p>
          <p>In addition to my experience from the defensive side, I have also received my Certified Ethical Hacker certification from EC-Council and I am well versed with a wide range of security tools such as NMAP, Metasploit, Wireshark, and OpenVAS.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">I am also proficient with social engineering. I have conducted many internal phishing simulation campaigns, and designed training programs around the results of these campaigns.</p>

          <div class="subheading">Non-Technical Skills</div>
          <p class="mb-4">Aside from my technical expertise, I also have experience working in customer service, training, and management. At one of my more recent employers, I designed their entire IT and security training program for all staff. I also lead this training on a monthly basis for all new hires during orientation.</p>
